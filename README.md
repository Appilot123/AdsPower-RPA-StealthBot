<h1 align="center">AdsPower RPA Stealth Bot</h1>

## Project Overview:

This project showcases a stealth automation bot built on top of **AdsPower's RPA and local API system**, designed to execute actions within AdsPower browser profiles with minimal detection risk. It leverages the anti-detect capabilities of AdsPower to simulate human-like behaviors for tasks such as warm-up routines, social engagement, and eCommerce operations. Unlike traditional Selenium or Puppeteer setups, this approach runs inside real browser environments backed by spoofed fingerprints—greatly improving safety and reducing bans. Ideal for platforms with strict bot detection like Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram.


## Core Features:
- **Native Profile Control via AdsPower API:** Interact directly with browser instances using AdsPower’s local APIs, giving full control over tabs, navigation, DOM interaction, and cookie/session handling.
- **Enhanced Stealth through Anti-Detect Environment:** Bypass traditional bot detection by running inside AdsPower’s fingerprinted browser environment—eliminating many automation fingerprints.
- **Modular and Scalable Bot Logic:** Build flexible workflows for tasks like account warm-up, data scraping, or form submission—scaling across 100s of isolated browser profiles in parallel.
